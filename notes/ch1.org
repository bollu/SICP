**  normal order and applicative order

  this bit is tricky. applicative order is the usual way I think of computation, apply and reduce. 
  normal order is reduce everything in one go and *then* apply. 

  applicative: apply->reduce. to the reduced form: apply->reduce.
    So, it's Expr->apply->reduce->apply->reduce->...->Result  'till you hit rock bottom

  normal: 1st reduce the given expression. To the reduced form, reduce again, and so on. 
    So, Expr->reduce->reduce->reduce->....->ReducedExpr->apply->Result
